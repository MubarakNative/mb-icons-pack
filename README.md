# MB Icons Pack  
A collection of free and open-source icons under the CC0 license.

## Availability  
The icons in this repository are **limited** because they are created entirely by me for my own projects.  
There are no external contributions at this time.  

I design new icons only when I need them for my work, so the collection will grow over time based on my project requirements.  

These icons are also used in my own projects and are available under the **CC0 1.0 Universal Public Domain** license. 

## License  
These icons are released under [CC0 1.0 Public Domain](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).  
Feel free to use them in any project without attribution.  

## Contributions  
If you want to **add your own icons** to this pack, you are welcome to contribute!  

However, all contributions must follow these rules:  
✅ Your icons must be **original creations** (no copyrighted material).  
✅ They must be **released under CC0 1.0 Universal** (public domain).  
✅ The icons should be in **SVG format** (preferably) or **PNG (high resolution)**.  
✅ Keep the file names simple and descriptive (e.g., `camera.svg`, `mic.png`).  
✅ Submit a **pull request** with a short description of your icons.
